#Introduction to Software Testing

Software testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding bugs in the program. It can also be said that software testing is the process of verifying and validating the software for:

    1. Meets the technical and business requirements
    2. Works as expected
    3. Can be implemented with the same characteristics.
    
#####The definition of software testing can be broken into two parts:
######Process: 
Testing can be considered as a process rather than an activity. 
######All lifecycle activities: 
Testing is a process that takes place throughout the software development lifecycle. By testing the software in the early stages in we can reduce the defects in the code. This is referred to as verifying the test basis via the test design. Test basis is a document that includes documents like the requirements and the design specifications.
######Static testing: 
Static testing is done without actually executing the code. static testing tests for the feasibility of all the documents and also a static analysis of all the documents. It is done during the verification phase.
######Dynamic testing: 
Dynamic testing is done by executing the code to check the results of the running test. It is done during the validation phase.
######Planning: 
We need to plan as to what we need to do. We control the test activities and report the status of the software under tests.
######Preparation: 
In the preparation phase we decide on the methods that we will use for testing and also on the selecting the testing conditions and designing test cases.
######Evaluation: 
During evaluation process we must verify the test results with the test criteria and the completion criteria. This helps us in deciding whether we have completed the testing and also helps us evaluate how the software is behaving.
######Software products and related work products: 
Along with testing the code, testing the requirements and design documents for feasibility is equally important. 

####Why is software testing necessary?
Software testing helps us to keep a check on the mistakes that we have made. If these mistakes are made later during the development of the software, they can be expensive or dangerous to the software. In order to reduce such errors, we perform testing. These mistakes generally happen due to bad assumptions or blind spots.
There are several reasons why testing is necessary, they are:

- Software testing is required because it finds out the errors and bugs that were made during the development of the software.
- It is essential since it makes sure of the customer reliability and their satisfaction in the product.
- Testing is done to keep a check on the quality of the product. If the customer is happy with the quality of the product then it helps in gaining the confidence of the customer.
- Testing is necessary in order to provide the facilities to the customers like the delivery of high quality product or software application which requires lower maintenance cost and hence results into more accurate, consistent and reliable results.
- Testing is required to assess the effective performance of the application.
- It is important to test that the software does not result in any failures. If the software results in failures in the later stages then these changes can be very expensive.
