#Lazy Systematic Unit Testing

Lazy Systematic Unit Testing is a unit testing method based on a combination of the Lazy Specification and Systematic Testing. Lazy specification is the dynamic analysis of a unit of the system in order to obtain the changing specification of the unit and Systematic Testing is the testing of a unit system exhaustively to bounded depths. JWalk Tester is a tool to perform Lazy Systematic Unit Testing in Java<sup>[5]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Software-Testing-Techniques/blob/master/Docs/References.md)</sup>.  

Lazy specification is an approach to Software Specification which is used when a code is modified very frequently. In this case, the software specification also changes in parallel to the changing code. The specification is generated automatically by the analysis of the developed unit. The analysis can be based either on the unit’s interface or the unit’s behavior. The term Lazy Specification is based on the term Lazy evaluation in Functional Programming where sub expressions are valuated only on demand. Similarly, the specification of the code is generated dynamically with changing code. The specification is complete only when the code is considered to be complete.

Systematic Testing is an approach to Software testing where the is tested exhaustively to show that it conforms to the specifications. The aim of this testing is to guarantee correctness repetitively once the testing is complete. Lazy Systematic Unit Testing is a technique which combines both the Lazy Specification approach and the Systematic Testing Approach to repetitively test a unit throughout its development to show that it corresponds to its given specifications at any given point of time.
