#API Testing

API testing is a tyoe of software testing that involves testing application application programming interfaces(API) directly as a part of integration testing to see if they meet the expectations for functionality, reliability, performance and security. Since API’s do not have a GUI, API testing is performed at message layer. API testing is now considered critical for automated testing because API’s now serve as a primary interface to application logic and because GUI tests are difficult to maintain with the short release cycle with respect to Agile Development model.
API testing involves testing API together as well as in isolation as part of the end to end integration testing. API testing is performed on APIs that are developed by the programmers or any third party API that is being used in the development of the software.
APIs are tested to check if the return correct results for a broad range of feasible requests, react appropriately to edge cases such as failures unexpected or extreme inputs, deliver results in accepted amounts of time and respond securely to possible security threats.

Types of API Testing:

API testing typically involves the following practices:
- Unit testing - Testing the functionality of individual operations.
- Functional testing - Testing the functionality of broader scenarios, often using unit tests as building blocks for end-to-end tests. Includes test case definition, execution, validation, and regression testing.
- Load testing - Validating functionality and performance under load, often by reusing functional test cases.
- Runtime error detection - Monitoring an application the execution of automated or manual tests to expose problems such as race conditions, exceptions, and resource leaks.
- Security testing - Includes penetration testing and fuzz testing as well as validating authentication, encryption, and access control.
- Web UI testing - Performed as part of end-to-end integration tests that also cover APIs, enables teams to validate GUI items in the context of the larger transaction.
